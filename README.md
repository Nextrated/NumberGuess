Guessing Game Smart Contract
The Guessing Game Smart Contract allows users to participate in a guessing game by paying a fee to guess a number from a pool of numbers. If their guess matches the randomly generated number, they receive rewards.

Contract Owner
The contract owner is the address that deployed the smart contract. Only the contract owner has the authority to withdraw funds from the contract.

Variables
contractOwner: An address variable that represents the owner of the contract.
guess: An unsigned integer variable that stores the user's guess.
guessFee: An unsigned integer variable that represents the fee required to participate in the game.
Guesslist: An array of unsigned integers that stores the pool of numbers for the game.
activeGuessNumber: An unsigned integer variable that represents the randomly generated number for each game.
callCounter: An unsigned integer variable that keeps track of the number of game rounds.
result: A string variable that holds the result of the game for the user.

Functions
constructor()
Initializes the contract owner.
Populates the Guesslist array with numbers from 1 to 5.

getActiveGuessNum()
Generates a random number from the Guesslist array based on the current callCounter.
Increments the callCounter to ensure the next game generates a different number.
Returns the active guess number.

guessNumber(uint256 pleaseEnterTheNumber)
Allows the user to submit their guess number.
Updates the guess variable with the provided number.
Calls the iterateGuessedNumber() function to check if the guess is correct.
Returns a boolean indicating whether the user won and the result string.

iterateGuessedNumber()
Calls the getActiveGuessNum() function to generate the active guess number.
Compares the user's guess with the active guess number to determine if the user won.
Updates the result string accordingly.

withdrawFunds()
Allows the contract owner to withdraw the contract's balance.
Verifies that the caller is the contract owner.
Transfers the contract balance to the contract owner's address.

generateRandomNumber(uint256 min, uint256 max)
Generates a random number within the specified range based on various parameters, including the current block's timestamp and difficulty.
Returns the randomly generated number.

Deployment and Interactions
Deploy the Guessing Game Smart Contract on an Evm compatible chain.
Interact with the contract using a wallet like MetaMask by calling the contract functions:
Call guessNumber(uint256 pleaseEnterTheNumber) by sending the guess and fee in wei to participate in the game.
Check the result by reading the returned boolean and string from the guessNumber() function.
Withdraw funds by calling the withdrawFunds() function if you are the contract owner.

Security Considerations
Ensure that the contract owner address is secure and protected as it has the authority to withdraw funds.
Thoroughly test the smart contract and handle possible edge cases to ensure its correctness.
Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and event logging, to enhance the contract's security.
